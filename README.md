# ASYNCHRONOUS PROGRAMMING
Program/Projects of Asynchronous programming which code helps you to understanding  for the concept of asynchronous program.

## TOPICS COVERED
1.Dart Async and Await
2.Future in Dart
3.Asynchronous programming.

### THEORY
>> Asynchronous programming basically means that it doesn't solve problem line by line.It allows you to perform other operation before it completes.
>> For Example:If I ordered some food from the online it will takes some time within that time I can do other stuff/work this clears the concept of asynchronous programming.'Future' , 'async' and 'await' are the terms you mostly used on asynchronous programming.
>> 
>> Future- It represents the value that is not yet available.It will available after some time in future.
>> 
>> Async-If you will add async before the body of the function it makes your function asynchrnous.
>> 
>> Await-It gives you the complete result of the asynchronous expression.


#### TO RUN THE PROGRAMME
-Downloads the projects file you want to perform.

-If you have install dart in your machine then type command in terminal as "dart programname.dart"
